                    <p>When Covid19 hit and youth needed safe exercise and transportation, newcomer youth around
                        Uniacke/Brunswick started a neighbourhood bicycle co-op to help the neighbourhood have access to
                        bicycles and learn how to fix and maintain their own bikes. Led by our chief mechanic Mohammad
                        Aljenadi, in the first year over 100 bicycles have been rescued from the trash and are repaired,
                        used, and shared by kids and youth in the North End.</p>

                        Debbie and Mostafa took action to organize neighbours, collecting signatures and petitioning the
                        city to slow down the traffic, which resulted in a decrease of the speed limit in the
                        neighbourhood. </p>

                        been served unjust evictions and were denied heat in their units over the winter.</p>

                        reconciliation, to build self confidence and resilience, to discuss and heal from topics
                        surrounding racism and discrimination, and to empower participants to have a voice to speak
                        about their own experiences of racism and discrimination through creative mediums.</p>

                <p>While Trellis Collective is made up of neighbours from many backgrounds and faiths in the
                    neighbourhood, there is a community of people who walk in the Jesus way together, sharing meals,
                    burdens, resources, and times of prayer and exploring scripture together. We look for and celebrate
                    the presence of God in our neighbourhoods and seek to stay in step as we find the Spirit dancing</p>
